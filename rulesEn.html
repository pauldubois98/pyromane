            <h1>The Pyromaniac Game</h1>
            <p class="paragraphe">In this game, you play a pyromaniac who wants to burn down a forest. As you are lazy, you want to light as few fires as possible, while burning as many trees as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraphe"><strong>Fire propagation rules:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraphe">A tree (green square) catches fire only if it is adjacent (1 adjacent side) to a fire (red square).</p>
            <div class="center"><img alt="explicationGIF" src="demo.gif" id="expl"></div>
            <p class="paragraphe"><strong>Where to put the initial fires:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraphe">To begin the party, the player will place strategically one or several fires (orange squares).</p>
            <p class="paragraphe"><em>Standard Game:</em></p>
            <p class="paragraphe">When the fire is started, each burned tree earns 1 point, while each fire placed at the beginning costs points (10 by default).</p>
            <p class="paragraphe"><em>One fire:</em></p>
            <p class="paragraphe">The pyromaniac player has 5 seconds to place a single fire, intended to burn as many trees as possible.</p>
            <p class="paragraphe"><em>Multi-players:</em></p>
            <p class="paragraphe">Players play each turn on the same forest, the one with the best score wins ... Luck is no longer an excuse!</p>
            <p class="paragraphe"><em>Settings:</em></p>
            <p class="paragraphe">It is possible to adjust the dimensions of the forest.<br>
            By default, it is a 20 square-sided forest.</p>
